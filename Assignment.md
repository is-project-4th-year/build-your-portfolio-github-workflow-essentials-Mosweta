## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought branching was just for different developers to do their modifications then push to the main.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out you can have as many branches as possible depending on the issue you are working on and it can be quite easy to track changes as long as the commits were done well.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created different branches for my portfolio to handle the different pages their updates, published them to the original repository and I must say it was very easy and I enjoyed. It was wonderful

**2. Concept: Merging**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I was expecting to learn how to resolve merge conflict.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: I learnt how a merge conflict arises, how to compare them using vs code editor and how to resolve them. I also learnt how to avoid getting them.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I learnt merging best practices like pulling from main to get any changes posted there and then adding your changes. I learnt how to simulate a merge conflict and resolve it. I must say I am definitely wiser and more knowledgeable.

**3. Concept: Committing from vscode**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I expected to learn how to commit from vscode.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: I learnt how to stage changes, write proper commits using appropriate commit conventions, create pull request and then review by a peer in a project collaboration then the asigned person merges to the main branch

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: This has made me to be more knowledgeable and confident in collaborating with others in a team project.

**4. Concept: Pulling and Pushing**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I wanted to learn how to pull and push.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: I learnt how to pull from remote repository main, stage your change, commit properly, push change to the remote branch, create a pull request, assign someone to review and merge it for you upon them ensuring everything is up to standard otherwise they can decline, then merge it. As a bonus I also learnt how to secure the main branch and deploy a static main.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: This made me to know correct procedures to follow in both an individual and collaborative project.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)
